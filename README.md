# OSF_reanalysis
Statistical analysis of Renkewitz and MÃ¼ller's (2016) OSF replication of Nairne's (2008) study 2 resulting from an assessment during my MRes. See the associated wiki for this project for further details.

# Pre-requisites
The only requirements are that you have R and RStudio installed and either run the package installation script [filename] first or you can copy the packages from the packrat library hosted [here]. 

# Data
Direct files are not provided as these are available from the OSF and the script retrieves them from there.
